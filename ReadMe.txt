User can register / login.

They can then post a deal which will be similar to those on hotukdeals.
Other users can view deals, vote on them (up or down) and comment.
Deals will be arranged in various ways in the frontend like on hotukdeals (Sorting options).

Users will have a my-account control panel which will show their running deals and allow them to manage those deals.
They will have a referral 'score' based on how popular their deals are.
This will work out to a percentage which the user can claim from affiliate payments made to us by Affiliate Window for their deal.
Not all deals will have affiliate referrals with Affiliate Window.
I assume that our API would need to query their API to determine if that particular retailer is offering a deal or not and then put it through as such.


I think that modules would be like this:

1. Authentication/Authorization 
2. Accounts
3. User Management
4. Deal Management
5. Dashboard for User/Admin
6. Referral System
7. Affiliation API Client
